# Recommendation System Based On User Input
Updated version of the recommendation system [here](https://github.com/sdhilip200/Content-Based-Recommendation---Good-Reads-data).
This version prompts the user to enter a string with a plot description and suggests top K most similar books from the Goodreads dataset and/or movies from the IMDB dataset.
This is a work in progress.
